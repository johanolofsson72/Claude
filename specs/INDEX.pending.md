# Pending-row diagnosis (archive)

The long form of rows not yet started. Never pipeline input.


## 007

_2026-09-03: folded into row 007 — one script, three defects. Row as it stood:_

- [ ] 007 — traceability-gate-conflates-two-failures — spec-only — `validate-scenario-traceability.sh` reports collisions and the coverage backlog through one `exit 1`, so a real collision is invisible behind a permanently-red backlog. Found by @david as agentcrm S3.

## 013

_2026-09-03: folded into row 007 — one script, three defects. Row as it stood:_

- [ ] 013 — traceability-self-test-straddles-its-timeout — spec-only — `validate-scenario-traceability.sh`'s own self-test runs 77s against its timeout, so it passes or fails by machine speed. Found as consultpilot H7bq.

## 016

_2026-09-03: folded into row 007 — one script, three defects. Row as it stood:_

- [ ] 016 — traceability-gate-floor-and-letter-ids — spec-only — the out-of-range floor is the map's lowest id, useless on a map starting at SC-001 (11 ids misfiled), and the gate cannot see letter ids, so nine `SC-A11` audits trace to nothing. Found as msroute 007cp + 007cw.
